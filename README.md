How to use the UI.

First page of the project is the index.html not the charts.html!! <-- for some reason the codegrade choose charts as first page, therefore switch to the index.html page.

Drag and drop Boxes to the map, to switch data, to access the data click on municipality, from this view you can proceed to the chart, by clicking the button accordingly.
